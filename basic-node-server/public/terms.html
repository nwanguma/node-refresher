        <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
        <p>
          The CICO service, website and/or software application (collectively,
          the “Service”) enables you to transfer funds between your mobile money
          wallet and your bank account, as well as to the wallet or account of
          another user. You may also use your supported mobile money wallet,
          account or credit card to pay for products and services offered by
          third parties (“Products”). The Service is operated by CicoServe
          Nigeria Limited (“CICO”), subject to these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
        </p>

      <div class="terms-body">
        <h3>Terms and condiitons</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>
              This is a contract. These Terms constitute a contract between you
              and CICO. You may not use the Service if you do not accept these
              Terms. By using any part of the Service you accept these Terms. If
              you are under eighteen (18) years of age, you may not use the
              Service.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              You must register an account with valid information. To use the
              Service, you must: (a) provide a valid mobile phone number; (b)
              agree to the creation of an account associated with such number;
              (c) accept the present Terms; and (d) submit such other and
              additional information as CICO may request. You agree to provide
              true, accurate and complete information about yourself as prompted
              by CICO during the account registration process. You will be given
              the option of receiving a unique PIN for purposes of reusing your
              account. You are responsible for keeping your PIN secure.

          <li>
            <span>
              Third party merchants offer the goods & services. The Service
              provides you with a method of discovering offers from independent
              third party merchants (“Merchants”). These Merchants sell their
              respective Products subject to their own terms and conditions. For
              example:
              <ul style="list-style: none; margin-top: 2rem; padding: 0 5rem">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
                  - Airtime: If you choose to purchase pre-paid airtime, you do
                  so pursuant to the relevant terms and conditions of your
                  mobile telecommunications provider.
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 2rem">
                  - Utilities: If you choose to purchase pre-paid electricity or
                  water, you do so pursuant to the relevant terms and conditions
                  of the utility provider.
                </li>
              </ul>
              If you decide to purchase Products such as these from third party
              Merchants, you do so at your own risk and subject to the relevant
              Merchant’s terms and conditions. The Products are not
              investigated, monitored, or checked for accuracy, reliability,
              appropriateness or completeness by CICO. By permitting you to
              discover Products via the Service, CICO does not imply approval or
              endorsement of such Products. You agree that CICO is not
              responsible or liable for the Products you purchase from
              Merchants.

          </li>

            <span>
              Payments are processed by third parties. In order to facilitate
              your purchases from Merchants, CICO has integrated its Service
              with the billing solutions of certain mobile money providers and
              credit card issuing banks (“Payment Processors”). If you purchase
              a Product from a Merchant using your supported mobile money wallet
              or account or credit card, payments will be processed by such
              Payment Processors. Payment Processors have their own terms and
              conditions governing your use of their payment services. You
              understand and agree that CICO does not process payments and is
              not responsible or liable for any transactions in which you
              engage. By engaging in a purchase transaction using your mobile
              money account or credit card, you authorize the Merchant (or CICO
              on its behalf) to bill your account or card for the purchase
              amount.
            </span>

          <li>

              Your privacy is important to us. CICO takes the matters of
              protection and security of its users’ information very seriously.
              CICO's privacy policy governing the Service is attached to these
              Terms (“Privacy Policy”). The Privacy Policy is incorporated into
              these Terms by this reference. By using the Service, you agree to
              the use of your data in accordance with CICO’s Privacy Policy. The
              Privacy Policy addresses only the information collected by CICO in
              providing the Service to you. Merchants and Payment Processors
              have their own information gathering practices that will apply
              when you choose to purchase Products.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              Product inquiries should be submitted to the relevant Merchant. If
              you have any questions, concerns or requests related to a Product
              you have purchased from a Merchant, you should contact the
              Merchant directly or contact us at technology@cico.ng. Each
              Merchant maintains its own customer contact desk for handling such
              requests, however CICO may do its best effort to assist you. If
              you wish to submit a complaint about the practices of a Merchant
              offering its Products via the Service, you may contact us by email
              at technology@cico.ng.

              You must not use the Service to violate any laws. You must not use
              the Service to violate or infringe the rights of any other person,
              including the rights of other users, CICO's rights in the Service
              or Merchants’ rights in their Products. You must not breach any
              laws or regulations when using the Service or attempt to disrupt
              or interfere with the security or functionality of the Service. In
              the event CICO has the suspicion you are using the Services for
              illegal activities such as fraud, CICO will block your account
              immediately.

              CICO may contact you regarding your account or the Service. You
              expressly agree that, as part of the Service, you may, from time
              to time, receive communications from CICO via email, instant
              message, telephone, text message (SMS) or other means. You may
              stop receiving promotional messages by emailing your request to
              opt-out, along with your cell phone number, to support@cico.team,
              or following the opt-out instructions in the message. Even if you
              choose to opt out of receiving promotional messages, you may not
              opt out of receiving service-related messages.
